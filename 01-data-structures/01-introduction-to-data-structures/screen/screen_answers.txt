How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
The data structure contains a nested array which allows developers to access and manipulate elements by index through the matrix.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
The 'find_index' is a universally good method to search this data structure. You can find the specific element's location or see what element is in a particular index.
