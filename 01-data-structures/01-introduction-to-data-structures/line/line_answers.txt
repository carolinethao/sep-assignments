How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
The data structure is an array which allows developers to access and manipulate elements by index.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
They could use the 'find_index' method to find where the element is located or to see what element is in that current index.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
This data structure could be useful in an app for taking reservation for a restaurant.
